Inferno HN - Hacker News PWA Clone

Live site is here https://infernohackernews.firebaseapp.com

InfernoJS Hacker News Clone with code splitting and PRPL pattern. 

Inferno is awesome and maybe the best virtual DOM library. Check it out [here](https://infernojs.org). Domminick Gannaway created it and has been called a [wizard](https://svelte.technology/blog/frameworks-without-the-framework). You can check him out [here](https://twitter.com/trueadm?lang=en) on Twitter or [here](https://github.com/trueadm) on Github.

I'm Naythan Williams and not a wizard. But I did build this PWA all by my lonesome. You can check out my boring Twitter [here](https://twitter.com/aretheregods) or my hopefully slightly less boring Github [here](https://github.com/aretheregods).

Now, go and build something awesome with InfernoJS. 
PS: You're allowed to use the structure of this PWA as a template for whatever awesome apps you build. I'm totally cool with that. But, remember, check out what architecture works best for whatever you're building. Peace.
